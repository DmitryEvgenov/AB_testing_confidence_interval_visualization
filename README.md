# A/B Testing with Confidence Interval Visualization

This project uses a random data generator to simulate an A/B testing scenario and displays the results in a visual manner.

The conversion rate and confidence interval for each variant (A or B) are calculated and displayed over time. 

The data is displayed as a line plot with the conversion rate as the y-axis and the date as the x-axis. The confidence interval is displayed as a shaded area around each line plot.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
